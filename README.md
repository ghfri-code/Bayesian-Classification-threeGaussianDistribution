# Bayesian Classification (Quadratic Multiclass Classification)
samples from three Gaussian distribution for each dataset described below:

**Dataset1:**

class1 :  $$ \qquad\mu = \binom{3}{6} \qquad \sum =\begin{pmatrix}1.5 & 0 \\0 & 1.5\end{pmatrix}$$

class2:  $$ \qquad\mu = \binom{5}{4} \qquad \sum =\begin{pmatrix}2 & 0 \\0 & 2\end{pmatrix}$$

class3:  $$\qquad \mu = \binom{6}{6} \qquad \sum =\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$$

**Dataset2:**

class1 :  $$\qquad \mu = \binom{3}{6} \qquad \sum =\begin{pmatrix}1.5 & 0.1 \\0.1 & 0.5\end{pmatrix}$$

class2:  $$\qquad \mu = \binom{5}{4} \qquad \sum =\begin{pmatrix}1 & -0.20 \\-0.20 & 2\end{pmatrix}$$

class3:  $$\qquad \mu = \binom{6}{6} \qquad \sum =\begin{pmatrix}2 & -0.25 \\-0.25 & 1.5\end{pmatrix}$$

â€¢ Consider the first 80% of the data in each class for train and the rest 20% for test and use a Bayesian classifier to classify both the train and test datasets and calculate both accuracies.

### Plot the decision boundary and classification results 

### Plot estimated PDFs. (3D for each dataset separately)

### Contour estimated PDFs along with the decision boundary. (2D for each dataset separately)

### What is the main difference between two datasets? 

### compare this part with partb of homework#2?

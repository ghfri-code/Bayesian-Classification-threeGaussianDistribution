# Bayesian Classification (Quadratic Multiclass Classification)
samples from three Gaussian distribution for each dataset described below:

Dataset#1:

Dataset#2:

â€¢ Consider the first 80% of the data in each class for train and the rest 20% for test and use a Bayesian classifier to classify both the train and test datasets and calculate both accuracies.

### Plot the decision boundary and classification results 

### Plot estimated PDFs. (3D for each dataset separately)

### Contour estimated PDFs along with the decision boundary. (2D for each dataset separately)

### What is the main difference between two datasets? 

### compare this part with partb of homework#2?

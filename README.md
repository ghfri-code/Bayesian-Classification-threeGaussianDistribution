# Bayesian Classification (Quadratic Multiclass Classification)
samples from three Gaussian distribution for each dataset described below:
Dataset#1:

Dataset#2:

• Consider the first 80% of the data in each class for train and the rest 20% for test.
• Use a Bayesian classifier to classify both the train and test datasets and calculate both accuracies (for each dataset separately).

### Plot the decision boundary and classification results 
• Plot estimated PDFs. (3D for each dataset separately)
• Contour estimated PDFs along with the decision boundary. (2D for each dataset separately)
• What is the main difference between two datasets? Explain your answer using your results and plots.
